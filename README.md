=================================================================

How the Project Works
Server Entry Point (server.js)

Initializes the Express app.

Loads middleware (body-parser, cookie-parser, file upload).

Sets up routing (routes.js).

Starts the server on a specific port.

Routing (routes.js)

Defines URL endpoints and maps them to controller functions.

Controllers (controllers/)

Each file handles a specific part of the application.

Example: playlist-controller.js manages playlist operations.

Models (models/)

Stores data in JSON files (playlists.json, tracks.json).

Uses lowdb for database-like functionality.

Views (views/)

Uses express-handlebars to generate dynamic HTML.


Run:
npm install

This project appears to be a simple playlist management system, handling user interactions through Express routes, storing data in JSON, and rendering views using Handlebars.
